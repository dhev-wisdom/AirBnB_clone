						The most recent entry to the Nayara brand has all the details covered. Cliff-top safari tents have spacious bathrooms
						with soaking tubs, private decks, and infinity plunge pools that overlook the lush Costa Rican rain forest and the
						imposing Arenal Volcano. Elsewhere on the property, guests can spot wildlife like sloths and toucans; take a dip in the
						B
						dramatic, cantilevered, hot-spring-fed mineral pools; and indulge in the plush spa.

						Part of the Virgin Limited Edition collection, Sir Richard Branson's majestic safari camp in the Masai Mara is
						"just perfect," according to one voter. The seemingly space-age tents somehow rise up out of the landscape and blend
						in with it simultaneously. Wildlife remains abundant in the surrounding bush — ideal for the twice-daily game
						drives — and the guides are extremely knowledgeable. One respondent raved about the "excellent service," adding that
						"the hospitality provided at Mahali Mzuri resembles the name," which means beautiful place in Swahili. Another reader
						says simply that it's "the best luxurious camp to visit on the African continent."

						Japanese architect Kengo Kuma designed this emerald glass building with subtle references to traditional Chinese architecture.
						Rooms are minimalist with luxurious touches like oak soaking tubs and plush beds, the staff is über-attentive, and the location
						is close to all the Beijing attractions.
